## Pin projects

### [RuCode: Home issue (XXX place), 2024](https://github.com/michael-bmstu/RuCode_2024)

This repository presents a solution to the task "Housing Issue" of the artificial intelligence track of the [RuCode](https://rucode.net/) 2024 festival.

It describes the basic data manipulations (NaN filling, EDA) that were performed to achieve the best result, parameter selection and training of the CarBoostRegressor model.


### [Clustering recomendation system, 2024](https://github.com/michael-bmstu/clustering_recomend_system)

One of the homework assignments for the [7-bit machine learning course](https://github.com/7bits/ml-courses-7bits) was to develop a recommender system.

The notebook included cleaning data from outliers, forming a one-hot table for training the KMeans clustering model; 
training the KMeans model and selecting the hyper parameter k (number of clusters). 
Finally, a recommendation algorithm was implemented based on user ratings for each genre and viewing history.


### [Pix2Pix with GAN, 2023](https://github.com/michael-bmstu/pix2pix_gan)

As part of the final project in the [DLS part 1 course](https://dls.samcs.ru/courses), a GAN model was developed to solve the pix2pix problem - changing the style of an image. The model changes the style of a face in an image into a comic.

The model inference is implemented via a telegram bot (currently not active), so you can start image processing yourself, having previously downloaded the weights. Just enter the token of your telegram bot in the bot.py file and run it.

### [RuCode: Vehicle Color Recognition (5-th place), 2022](https://github.com/michael-bmstu/RuCode_2022)
This repository presents a solution to the task "Vehicle Color Recognition" of the artificial intelligence track of the [RuCode](https://rucode.net/) 2022 festival.

I built a pipeline to train the ResNet101 model using photos of cars of different colors. As a result of training, the quality of the model reached the value = 0.9856 of the metric f1-score.


### [Hinge Knitter, 2021](https://github.com/michael-bmstu/HingeKnitter)

Hinge Knitter is a computational tool designed to identify and manipulate specific RNA sequences within a given RNA chain. The program facilitates the generation of multiple instances of a specified sequence, appending these instances to the original RNA sequence retrieved from a hinge file. This functionality is particularly useful in the context of molecular biology and bioinformatics.

For ease of use, the program has a graphical interface using PyQt5, where you can select the input directory, output directory, and hinge file.
