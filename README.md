## üíº My projects and achievements

### [Gradio interface for clustering recomendation system, 2025](https://github.com/michael-bmstu/recsys-gradio)

Implementation of a web interface based on the Gradio library for a [recommender system](https://github.com/michael-bmstu/clustering_recomend_system)

* Technology stack used: Fast API, Docker, DVC, Gradio, Scikit-learn, Pandas

### [Streamlit interface for Rucode 2024 task "Housing Issue", 2025](https://github.com/michael-bmstu/house-issue-prod)

Implementation of a web interface based on a library Stramlit for solving the ["Housing issue" problem](https://github.com/michael-bmstu/RuCode_2024)
of the artificial intelligence track of the RuCode 2024 festival.

* Technology stack used: Streamlit, Scikit-learn, CatBoost, Pandas.

### [RuCode: Housing Issue (2-nd place), 2024](https://github.com/michael-bmstu/RuCode_2024)

This repository presents a solution to the task "Housing Issue" of the artificial intelligence track of the [RuCode](https://rucode.net/) 2024 festival.

It describes the basic data manipulations (NaN filling, EDA) that were performed to achieve the best result, parameter selection and training of the CarBoostRegressor model.

* Technology stack used: Scikit-learn, CatBoost, Pandas, Matplotlib, Optuna.


### [DLS x ecom.tech workshop (20-th place), 2024](https://github.com/michael-bmstu/ecom-t_x_dls)

This repository presents the top 20 solutions to the problem of multilabel classification using the CatBoost (ML) and BERT (DL) models.
The [competition](https://ods.ai/competitions/dls_ecomtech) was held at the DLS and ecom.tech workshop.

* Technology stack used: PyTorch, Transformers, CatBoost, Pandas, Matplotlib.



### [Clustering recomendation system, 2024](https://github.com/michael-bmstu/clustering_recomend_system)

One of the homework assignments for the [7-bit machine learning course](https://github.com/7bits/ml-courses-7bits) was to develop a recommender system.

The notebook included cleaning data from outliers, forming a one-hot table for training the KMeans clustering model; 
training the KMeans model and selecting the hyper parameter k (number of clusters). 
Finally, a recommendation algorithm was implemented based on user ratings for each genre and viewing history.

* Technology stack used: Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.


### [Pix2Pix with GAN, 2023](https://github.com/michael-bmstu/pix2pix_gan)

As part of the final project in the [DLS part 1 course](https://dls.samcs.ru/courses), a GAN model was developed to solve the pix2pix problem - changing the style of an image. The model changes the style of a face in an image into a comic.

The model inference is implemented via a telegram bot (currently not active), so you can start image processing yourself, having previously downloaded the weights. Just enter the token of your telegram bot in the bot.py file and run it.

* Technology stack used: PyTorch, Torchvision, Matplotlib

### [RuCode: Vehicle Color Recognition (5-th place), 2022](https://github.com/michael-bmstu/RuCode_2022)
This repository presents a solution to the task "Vehicle Color Recognition" of the artificial intelligence track of the [RuCode](https://rucode.net/) 2022 festival.

I built a pipeline to train the ResNet101 model using photos of cars of different colors. As a result of training, the quality of the model reached the value = 0.9856 of the metric f1-score.

* Technology stack used: PyTorch, Torchvision, Matplotlib.
